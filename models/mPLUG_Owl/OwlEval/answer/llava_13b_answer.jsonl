{"image": "6.jpg", "question_id": 9, "question": "What should I do after kneading the dough, before dividing it into pieces?", "answer": "After kneading the dough, before dividing it into pieces, you should let it rest and rise. This step, also known as proofing, allows the yeast in the dough to produce gas, which helps the dough rise and develop its characteristic texture. This process usually takes about 1-2 hours, depending on the type of dough and environmental conditions. To check if the dough has risen sufficiently, gently press your finger into the center of the dough; if the indentation remains, it's ready for the next step. Once the dough has risen, you can divide it into desired pieces using a knife or a dough cutter, and then shape each piece into a loaf or a specific form, depending on the type of bread or your preference. After shaping, you can place the loaves on a baking sheet or a stone, and then preheat your oven to the appropriate temperature for baking.", "model_id": "llava-13b"}
{"image": "6.jpg", "question_id": 10, "question": "How long should I put in warm places?", "answer": "When preparing bread dough, it is essential to let it rise in a warm place. A suitable temperature range for proofing dough is between 70°F and 95°F (21°C and 35°C). To ensure consistent and ideal rising conditions, it is best to place the dough in a warm, draft-free area, away from direct sunlight or heat sources. If you're using an oven, you can turn it on to a low temperature (around 45°F or 7°C) to provide gentle warmth. Alternatively, you can place the dough near a window with sun exposure, as long as the temperature remains moderate and the dough isn't exposed to extreme temperature fluctuations. Maintaining consistent temperature and conditions will help the dough rise evenly and efficiently.", "model_id": "llava-13b"}
