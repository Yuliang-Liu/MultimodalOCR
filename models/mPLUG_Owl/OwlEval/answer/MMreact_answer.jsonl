This question requires further context.\n3. This question requires Internet search.\nAI: The history of castles dates back to the early forms of simple wooden palisades, which sometimes had earthworks surrounding a camp and a permanent wooden tower in the center. These structures evolved into motte and bailey castles, which featured a wall encircling an open space or courtyard (bailey) and a natural or artificial hill (motte) with a wooden tower built on top.\nIn Western Europe, the development of castles accelerated from the 9th century. Fortifications built in France during the 10th century often included a high mound encircled by a ditch and surmounted by the leader’s stronghold, as seen in the castles at Blois and Saumur.", "model_id": "MMreact"}
